Part 2 
======

I'm a tester, which means I come at the end of our team's food chain.
I take the programmer's work as input (most of the time it will be an executable),
and perform the tests on it, then give a feedback to the programmer.
My tests will be based on the SRS written by the Analyst, formally documented and
uploaded to Sharepoint using the template provided on moodle.

My planning is to start to document the tests as soon as the SRS is available.
This first work should be the longest. Once it's done, I will depends on the
programmers delivering working executables to test. There's also the possibility 
that, as we progress toward the project, we'll need to add some tests, but if
the initial work is done right, there shouldn't be much.
