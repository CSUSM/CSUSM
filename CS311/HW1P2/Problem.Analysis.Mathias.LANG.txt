I did the Problem Analysis 1 in class, so there's Problem ANalysis 2:

Traffic Signal Controller
=========================

The algorithm is pretty simple.

The following lights are paired:
- North & South (NS);
- East & West (EW);
- NL & SL;
- EL & WL;

Each light is activated alternatively every 1m30s.
Sensors are present, and any empty line is skipped.
In addition, if a pedestrian button is crossed, the next turn will be on NS or EW, depending on which button was pressed, unless it was pressed in the last 4 turns (6 minutes).

This algorithm is fairly simple and aim to avoid the worst waiting time. It's also fairly generic, as we don't have detailled information about the intersection business, rush hours or so on.
